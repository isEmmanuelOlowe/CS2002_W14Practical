 id="x1-3000"></a>Overview</h4>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >In this practical you will write an array-based implementation of a fixed-size generic Stack in C. You will design
and implement tests to check correct operation of your stack. You will then use/extend your first Stack
implementation to provide a thread-safe, BlockingStack implementation and design and implement tests for
your BlockingStack.

<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Please note that the <span

class="pplb7t-">Take care that you do not accidentally decompress it again once you have worked on</span>
<span 
class="pplb7t-">your assignment, thereby accidentally overwriting your own implementation.</span>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Stack Implementation</h4>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >You are required to develop and test a generic, fixed-size stack implementation in accordance with the module
interface in <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack.h</span>. As usual, coding to an interface is important, so please don&#8217;t change the Stack function
signatures that are provided.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />You are supplied with a <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack.c </span>file containing the stack functions which do not do anything
sensible yet and which you will have to implement. You are also provided with a <span 
class="pcrr7t-">TestStack.c </span>file
into which you should write tests to verify correct operation of your stack. The file contains two
simple tests to show you how to write tests and call your test functions from the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">main </span>function in
<span 
class="pcrr7t-">TestStack.c</span>.
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />You are supposed to use dynamic memory allocation and pointers to structs for your Stack data type and
functions. You may find material in C_SP Lectures 7 - 10 useful, including the Person example
L07-08/PersonStructDynamic. While you are supposed to implement this stack using a dynamically allocated
array, you may also find the Linked List example L10/IntegerList interesting from the point of view of seeing
how an integer list can be implemented in C using dynamic memory allocation. There are hints in the lecture
how you might create a generic list instead.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />You will have to add suitable members to the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">struct Stack </span>definition in <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack.h</span>. You should examine the
function declarations and comments for each function in <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack.h </span>to give you an insight into how you should
implement your stack, what elements you should add to your <span 
class="pcrr7t-">struct Stack</span>, and what the expected
behaviour of the functions is.
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />For example, <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_push(Stack&#x22C6; this, void&#x22C6; element) </span>takes a <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack&#x22C6; </span>argument (i.e. a pointer to a
<span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack </span>struct) representing the stack on which to operate, and a generic (in the C sense) <span 
class="pcrr7t-">void&#x22C6; </span>argument,
representing the element that should be pushed onto the stack. As such, it should be possible to push a pointer
to any value onto the stack. The code comment specifies that the function should return <span 
class="pcrr7t-">true on success</span>
<span 
class="pcrr7t-">and false on push failure when element is NULL or stack is full</span>. As such, NULL values
are not permitted in this stack and the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">push </span>operation should return false in this case or if the stack is
full.
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />The <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack&#x22C6; new</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_Stack(int max</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_size) </span>&#8221;constructor&#8221; function takes a size parameter and returns a
pointer to a new, suitably initialised <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack </span>struct for which memory should have been allocated dynamically.
As the maximum stack size is not known at compile time, you should also use dynamic memory allocation for
the stack&#8217;s <span 
class="pcrr7t-">store</span>. You will have to allocate enough space for a dynamically allocated array of <span 
class="pcrr7t-">max</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_size</span>
<span 
class="pcrr7t-">void&#x22C6; </span>elements.
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />As you develop your implementation, you should also write Stack tests (such as <span 
class="pcrr7t-">pushOneElement() </span>for
example) by writing functions in <span 
class="pcrr7t-">TestStack.c </span>as indicated in the file and calling these by adding lines
(such <span 
class="pcrr7t-">runTest(pushOneElement);</span>) to the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">main </span>function. Although your stack is designed to
store non-NULL, generic <span 
class="pcrr7t-">void &#x22C6; </span>pointers, it can also be used to store non-zero integers directly if
you want, because an <span 
class="pcrr7t-">int </span>can safely be cast to <span 
class="pcrr7t-">void&#x22C6; </span>before pushing and cast back to <span 
class="pcrr7t-">int </span>when
popping.
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />There is a simple <span 
class="pcrr7t-">assert </span>statement that you can make use of in tests and which is defined in &#8221;<span 
class="pcrr7t-">myassert.h</span>&#8221;.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
A <span 
class="pcrr7t-">setup </span>function in <span 
class="pcrr7t-">TestStack.c </span>is designed to create a new stack with some default size which can be used
for each test. Similarly, a <span 
class="pcrr7t-">teardown </span>function has been provided to destroy the test stack after each
test. The <span 
class="pcrr7t-">setup </span>and <span 
class="pcrr7t-">teardown </span>functions are called by <span 
class="pcrr7t-">runTest </span>before and after running each
test.
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />Instructions on &#8221;Compiling Testing and Stacscheck&#8221; and some &#8221;General Tips&#8221; are given below after the
&#8221;Thread-Safe Blocking Stack&#8221; section. Please do read these before starting, as they may help you avoid
problems down the line.
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Thread-Safe Blocking Stack</h4>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Once you have developed and tested your stack implementation and are sure that it works, you can move on.
In this part, you are going to develop and test a thread-safe blocking version of your fixed-size stack in the
associated files <span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack.h</span>, <span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack.c </span>and <span 
class="pcrr7t-">TestBlockingStack.c</span>. The thread-safe
BlockingStack has the same core operations as a Stack, but with some crucial differences in blocking when
full/empty (on push/pop respectively) as outlined in the code comments in the module interface
<span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack.h</span>.
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />There are different ways to approach this task, one which involves re-use, where your <span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack</span>
essentially contains a <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack </span>and the <span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_ </span>functions add the thread-safety, the blocking aspects,
and call the corresponding <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_ </span>functions. Alternatively, you could design your <span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack </span>as a
completely independent module which does not have to call functions defined in <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack.c</span>. There are
probably pros and cons to each approach and you should consider these prior to starting this
part.
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />The blocking property should not have to involve busy-waiting, so you will use semaphores for this bit.
Thread-safety should be ensured by using mutexes. Please note that the BlockingStack itself and its operations
should be thread-safe and satisfy the semantics of blocking when full/empty without the calling (client) code
having to operate on any mutexes or semaphores directly. Client code should merely have to call the functions
defined in the module interface. As such, you should consider where the mutex and semaphores should be
stored for your <span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack </span>object.
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />When designing, implementing and testing your blocking stack implementation, you should make sure you
understand the material covered in C_SP Lectures 16 - 17 and may find it useful to study examples
L16/threads2 (for creating and joining threads), L17/thr_broken_fixed5 (for use of mutexes in making access to
<span 
class="pcrr7t-">bowl </span>and <span 
class="pcrr7t-">tap </span>thread-safe), L19/bounded_buffer and L19/bounded_buffer_named_sems (to see
how mutexes and semaphores are used to provide thread-safe, blocking access to a shared integer
array).
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" ><br 
class="newline" />The tests you write for your blocking stack in <span 
class="pcrr7t-">TestBlockingStack.c </span>should test the basic stack operations
in a similar way to how your Stack was tested in the first part. However, you should also write one or more
tests that create a number of threads (at least two threads) which access a single blocking stack. The threads
might each execute either a suitable number of <span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_push </span>or <span 
class="pcrr7t-">BlockingStack</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_pop </span>operations
on the shared stack and the test might involve checking whether all values pushed onto the stack are also
eventually popped. The L19 bounded buffer examples (and associated discussion in the lecture) may be of use
here. You might also be able to demonstrate the blocking aspect visually in a different test/program by
making the either the pushing or popping thread sleep occasionally such that the other thread has to
block.

 id="x1-8000"></a>General Tips</h4>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Don&#8217;t  try  to  develop  the  whole  implementation  in  one  go  as  this  will  probably  result  in
     more bugs and lengthier, more painful debugging. Instead, it may be sensible to develop your
     implementation in stages using a TDD approach, writing tests as you go.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">At the start, you will have to choose a suitable struct to represent your stack and will have to
     ensure you can allocate memory for the stack and its elements. At that point you probably want
     to implement your <span 
class="pcrr7t-">new</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_Stack </span>and <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_size </span>functions such that that you can get the two
     supplied tests to pass.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The next step might be to implement <span 
class="pcrr7t-">Stack</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">_isEmpty </span>and to write a test for this function.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Once your implementation passes tests for size and isEmpty, you can probably move on to the
     other operations: push, pop, clear, and destroy, writing suitable tests as you go.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Only <span 
class="pplri7t-">free </span>things you have <span 
class="pplri7t-">malloc</span>-ed, or else bad things happen.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Repeat the step-by-step development approach for your BlockingStack implementation.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">When using semaphores and mutexes for the thread-safe blocking stack, make sure you always
     initialise these properly.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Always check the manual pages for the functions you call.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Check POSIX function return values &#8211; checking the return values from mutex and semaphore
     functions is very important, as is writing suitable error and cleanup functions as shown in the L19
     bounded buffer example &#8211; this is a good way to cut down on debugging time.
     </li></ul>
