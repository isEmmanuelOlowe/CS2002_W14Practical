# W14 Practical

## Overview

The specification requires that a implementation of a array-based fixed-size generic stack in C.  Then to design and implement unit tests to check if the functionality of the stack operations has been correctly implemented. Also the specification requires that the initial program is extended to provide a thread-safe Blocking Stack and then to provide tests for the blocking stack.

### Assumptions

* Function signatures must not be changed
*
